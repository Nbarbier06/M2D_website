This repository contains a simple example widget to display a catalogue of AI solution providers.

The `widget/` folder includes:

- `index.html` – main page showcasing the catalogue
- `style.css` – styles for catalogue cards
- `script.js` – JavaScript fetching records from AirTable

A self-contained `catalogue-widget.html` is provided at the repository root for easy copy-paste into WordPress.

To test locally, open `widget/index.html` in a browser. On WordPress, you can copy the HTML, CSS, and JS into a custom widget or plugin.
