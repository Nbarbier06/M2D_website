This repository contains a simple example widget to display a catalogue of AI solution providers.

The `widget/` folder includes:

- `index.html` – main page showcasing the catalogue
- `style.css` – styles for catalogue cards
- `script.js` – JavaScript fetching records from AirTable
- `catalogue-widget.html` – self‑contained snippet with HTML, CSS and JS

To test locally, open `widget/index.html` in a browser. On WordPress, you can either copy the separate files or use `catalogue-widget.html` to paste a single block containing everything in one file.
